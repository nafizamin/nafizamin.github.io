<h3>Enjoys working with optics, photonics and coding!</h3>
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the ECE Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I joined the Applied Optics group under the supervision of Prof. Holger Schmidt in 2017. Before this, I completed my bachelor's from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in Dhaka, Bangladesh. </p>

I spend a lot of time with lasers, optical fibers, and different lightwave instruments. A fun thing I often try is to estimate the wavelength of visible light just by looking at its color! </p>

I have been very lucky to call UCSC and its nature my campus. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, and taking photos. I will try to update my photo gallery here regularly!</p>
