<h3>Actively interested in photonics, quantum computing, and coding!</h3>
<p>I am currently working as an Optical Engineer on the developmnt of HAMR drives at TDK Headway Technologies. I received my Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I worked in the Applied Optics lab under Prof. Holger Schmidt for my graduate research. Before this, I completed my bachelor's from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in Dhaka, Bangladesh. </p>

I spend a lot of time with lasers, optical fibers, and different lightwave instruments. A fun thing I often try is to estimate the wavelength of visible light just by looking at its color! </p>

I have been very lucky to call Santa Cruz my home for many years. Outside work, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, and taking photos. I will try to update my photo gallery here regularly!</p>
